Ludum Dare 24

The Singularity is Here!
========================

Description:
============

The year is 2045, and the singularity is here. Machines have evolved, and
they're gunning for us. Ray Kurzweil predicted it, but he didn't imagine that
it would start an armageddon between man and machine. Our three heroes, 
Kurtz, Tuxxer and Charlie, set off in a daring do or die adventure to destroy
the central computer which runs all of the AI.

Destroy the evil AI ships so you can plant the nuke at the central computer.
You have three unique lives to do so.

The game has three subtle modes:

Easy: Finish the game. Everyone is expendable.
Medium: Finish the game only losing one comrade.
Hard: Finish the game with the whole team in one piece.
